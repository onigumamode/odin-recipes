        <h3>Description</h3>
    </p>
    <p>This gluten free okonomiyaki recipe makes a savory pancake dinner that has become a staple in our house. We often make a double batch to use up more cabbage and eggs - the leftovers keep well, and can be reheated on the stove top or in a toaster oven to keep them nice and crispy.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ head of small cabbage finely shredded </li>
            <li>2 thinly sliced spring onions </li>
            <li>4 shitake mushrooms thinly sliced (any mushrooms will work fine) </li>
            <li>1 portion of My Heart Beets 3 Ingredient Naan batter (1/2 cup almond flour, 1/2 cup tapioca flour, 1 cup coconut milk mixed together) </li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp grated ginger </li>
            <li>½ tsp garlic powder </li>
            <li>½ tsp onion powder </li>
            <li>¼ cup water </li>
            <li>pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Optional - protein (we like to fry a bit of bacon right before we pour the batter into the pan, but shrimp or strips of tofu are also delicious!)</li>
            <li>Mayo, aonori, and okonomiyaki sauce to taste for serving</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wisk together the almond flour, tapioca flour, and coconut milk</li>
            <li>Add eggs one and a time, mixing between each addition</li>
            <li>Add the seasonings, spring onions, mushrooms, and finally the cabbage. Don't over add cabbage - the batter should still look wet and be able to cover the cabbage well</li>
            <li>Heat a swirl of oil in a pan or a griddle on medium heat. Fry the protein in the pan for a minute or so if using, then pour a ladle of batter over it/into the pan or griddle</li>
            <li>Fry until it is crispy and golden on one side, then flip and fry the other side until it is golden as well</li>
            <li>Serve with mayo, okonomiyaki sauce, and aonori to taste</li>
        </ol>
